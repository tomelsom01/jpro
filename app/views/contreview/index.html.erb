    <p>The Contemporary Review (CR), a monthly magazine, was founded in 1866 as a vehicle for the growing community of writers and intellectuals who sought to explore the prospects for a brave new world transformed by scientific knowledge and the Industrial Revolution. It was ‘left-of-centre’, with unofficial links to the Liberal Party, progressively Christian, or humanist in outlook. Its early contributors included John Ruskin, Aldous Huxley, W.E. Gladstone, Matthew Arnold, and J.M. Barrie.
    Under two long-standing editors, Percy Bunting (1882-1911) and G.P. Gooch (1911-1960), the historian and Liberal MP for Bath, CR developed a wide and international readership, across Europe and the Empire. During the 1950s, its familiar yellow and black cover could be seen in most newsagents, until (like its comrade from the Victorian age, Punch) it ceased publication in 2013.
    John joined the Liberal Party in 1964, stood unsuccessfully for parliament and the Greater London Council (GLC), and became an adviser to the party on arts and broadcasting. He was invited by Rosalind Wade, the novelist, who took over as CR editor in 1966, to contribute articles on a regular basis – six a year. John agreed on the understanding that these should not be about theatre or the arts, but about politics, social change, and travel. They describe such events as the formation of the LibDem Alliance, the arrival of broadband, and the end of Soviet rule in Central and Eastern Europe.
