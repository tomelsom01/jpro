        <p class="sizebooks">A comedy about the deception that convinces and the reality that deceives.
          On his retirement, Monty, a senior government adviser, behaves very recklessly. He obtains a work visa for his beautiful young interpreter from Belarus and sets her up with a flat of her own in Soho. Is she, his mistress? Is he planning marriage? Has he acted from the goodness in his heart? He persuades his ‘virtual’ nephew, a would-be journalist, to go to the Edinburgh International Festival with her. What on earth is he trying to do?
