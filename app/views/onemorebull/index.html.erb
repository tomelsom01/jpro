        <p class="sizebooks">A young man, Roger, comes to a London office, hoping to speak to his father, Mr. Bull. He is stopped from doing so by his father’s personal secretary and an officious doorman. When his father dies, Roger takes his place and changes the business model with disastrous results. He sells the firm, finds freedom, and escapes with the secretary into a sunlit (but uncertain) future. </p>
