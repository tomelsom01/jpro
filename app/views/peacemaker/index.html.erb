          <h4>ADC Theatre, Cambridge – 1956</h4>

          <p>Musical play, with music by Sally Mays and movement by Jean Denning, written and directed by John Elsom.</p>
          <p>A stranger arrives in a foreign country, torn by civil war, where he is welcomed as a saviour. One way to quell the factions is by threatening world destruction. The alternative is laughter. </p>
          <p>‘This sense of unity is emphasized through the production, in which words, music and movement are treated as being equally important.’ The Times. Aug 1956 (→further press)</p>
