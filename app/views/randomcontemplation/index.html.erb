    <p>In March 1985, the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Konstantin Chernenko, died, and was succeeded by a younger man, Mikhail Gorbachev, with a mission to bring the Cold War to an end. As an independent journalist and an IATC Vice-President, John was attending a conference in Moscow at the time of Chernenko’s funeral. He was drawn into discussions about how the cultural relations between the East and the West could be improved. In the same year, at a festival in Rome, John was elected IATC world president, with the support of the US and Soviet delegations. The common aim was to promote international friendship through theatre festivals and academic conferences, some described in John’s articles for the US magazine, The World & I, and his broadcasts for the BBC.</p>

    <p>The spirit of Glasnost (openness) did not last for long. The national rivalries, suppressed by the Cold War, once more asserted their strength. In Putin’s Russia, there was a call to restore Holy Russia, its medieval empire. In the US, President Trump swore to ‘Make America Great Again’. In Britain, a referendum resulted in a decision to leave the European Union. One MP, Jo Cox, spoke out against Brexit and was murdered in her constituency.</p>

    <p> In the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, John produced and directed a festival for the Korean community with the support of the Korean Cultural Centre, the Rose Theatre, All Saints Church and RBK Borough Council. It celebrated the happy and peaceful relationship between two vastly different national cultures, a model for harmony elsewhere. This friendship began, however, in the dark days before the end of the Second World War, when the Allies destroyed the Japanese town of Hiroshima, whose anniversary was also remembered.</p>

  <h2>Sally Mays</h2>
  <p>In April 2018, Sally Mays, the Australian pianist, died from lung cancer. She was John’s wife and partner in a marriage that lasted over sixty-three years. In December 2019, her friends gathered for a memorial concert, held at All Saints Church, Kingston. </p>
  <br>
  <p>	Three songs from Sally’s memorial concert. Words by John Elsom, music by David Sutton Anderson, sung by Lauren Lodge-Campbell. (Video by George Venus)</p>
  <p>A: The Apple of My Eye</p>
  <p>We kept it cool. We kept it dry,
We did not want our friends to pry,
For I was only seventeen, and she,
The apple of my eye.
</p>
<p>We made no plans, and if we met,
We’d touch, and gently touch, not grope,
For she came from another world,
And I was full of love and hope.
</p>
<p>Through shafts of light, to muffled drums,
We swore we’d leave it all to chance.
Let’s face the future, as it comes!
And so began our lifelong dance.
</p>
<p>We had no doubt, we had no fear,
We did not play it by the rule,
For she was on her grand career,
And I stood firm (though still at school).
</p>
<p>Living alone in a house,
Waiting for no-one to come,
Where are they now?
Kisses that fastened my heart and stopped my mouth
Dumb.
</p>
<p>B: Home Delivery</p>
<p>We paced the floor, my son and I,
The midwife came and crossed the hall,
And closed the door. ‘What’s wrong with Mum?’
‘Nothing,’ I said, ‘Nothing at all’.
</p>
<p>Great clouds of smog rolled up the Thames,
A thick and grey primordial soup.
We drew the blinds against the dark.
Nothing could let our spirit droop.
</p>
<p>‘Can I go in?’ ‘Not yet, not yet,
Let’s stick around and say our prayers.
There’s nothing much we men can do.
Let’s leave the girls to their affairs.’
</p>
<p>The house was softly drenched in mist.
The silence even soaked the earth.
Awestruck we stood, restless to hear
The first uncertainties of birth.
</p>
<p>C: Silence</p>
<p>The skills of eighty years
Have left her hands.
</p>
<p>The words that spoke her mind
Escape her lips.
</p>
<p>The house that sang of love
Has lost its voice.
</p>
<p>Silence, my dear friends, is a deep hole.</p>
