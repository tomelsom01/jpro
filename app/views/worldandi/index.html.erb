    <p>In 1979, John joined the International Association of Theatre Critics (IATC/AICT), a UNESCO NGO (Non-Governmental Agency), which brings together those (world-wide) who write about the theatre – journalists, academics, and literary managers. The Cold War, which had dominated international relations since the end of WW2, was coming to an end. Following a period of détente, the barriers that separated East from West were broken down, culminating in the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
    John was elected in Mexico as an IATC Vice-President in 1984, and as world President in Rome in 1985, a role that he retained until 1992, twice re-elected. His aim was to overcome the decades of Cold War hostilities, encourage the appreciation of diverse cultures, and to support conferences and festivals. He was helped by the British Council, ministries of culture in IATC member countries, and by City University in London, where he started a post-graduate course in Arts Policy and Criticism.
    He continued to write talks and programmes for the BBC. John was an associate arts editor for the US magazine, The World & I, published by The Washington Times. His articles include:
